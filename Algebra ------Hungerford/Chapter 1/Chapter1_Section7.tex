\section{Categories: products, coproducts, and free objects}
\begin{ex}
    A \emph{pointed set} is a pair $(S,x)$ with $S$ a set and $x\in S$. A morphism of pointed sets $(S,x)\to (S', x')$ is a triple $(f,x,x')$, where $S\to S'$ is a function such that $f(x)=x'$. Show that pointed sets form a category.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    If $f:A\to B$ is an equivalence in a category $\mathcal{C}$ and $g:B\to A$ is the morphism such that $g\circ f=1_{A}$, $f\circ g=1_{B}$, show that $g$ is unique.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    In the category $\mathcal{G}$ of groups, show that the group $G_{1}\times G_{2}$ together with the homomorphisms $\pi_{1}:G_{1}\times G_{2}\to G_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}:G_{1}\times G_{2}\to G_{2}$ is a product for $\{G_{1},G_{2}\}$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    In the category $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian groups, show that the group $A_{1}\times A_{2}$ together with the morphisms $\tau_{1}:A_{1}\to A_{1}\times A_{2}$ and $\tau_{2}:A_{2}\to A_{1}\times A_{2}$ is a coproduct of $\{A_{1}, A_{2}\}$.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Every family $\{A_{i}|i\in I\}$ in the category of sets has a coproduct.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that in the category $\mathcal{S}_{*}$ of pointed sets product always exist; describe them.
        \item Show that in $\mathcal{S}_{*}$ every family of objects has a coproduct, describe the coproduct.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Let $F$ be a free object on a set $X(i:X\to F)$ in a concrete category $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ contains an object whose underlying set has at least two elements in it, then $i$ is an injective map of sets.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Suppose $X$ is a set and $F$ is a free object on $X$ (with $i:X\to F$) in the category of groups. Prove that $i(X)$ is a set of generators for the group $F$.
