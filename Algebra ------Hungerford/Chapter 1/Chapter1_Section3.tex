\begin{ex}
    Let $a,b$ be elements of group $G$. Show that $\left| a \right| =\left| a^{-1} \right| $; $\left| ab \right| =\left| ba \right| $, and $\left| a \right| =\left| cac^{-1} \right| $ for all $c\in G$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Let $G$ be an abelian group containing elements $a$ and $b$ of orders $m$ and $n$ respectively. Show that $G$ contains an element whose order is the least commom multiple of $m$ and $n$.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $pq$, with $(p,q)=1$. Assume there exist $a,b\in G$ such that $\left| a \right| =p, \left| b \right| =q$ and show that $G$ is cyclic.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    If $f:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, $a\in G$, and $f(a)$ has finte order in $H$, then $\left| a \right| $ is infinite or $\left| f(a) \right| $ divides $\left| a \right| $.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Let $G$ be the multiplicative group of all nonsingular $2\times 2$ matrices with rational entries. Show that $a=\begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -1\\1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}$has order 4 and $b=\begin{pmatrix}
        0& 1\\-1&-1
    \end{pmatrix}$has order 3, but $ab$ has infinite order. Conversely, show that the additive group $Z_{2}\oplus \mathbf{Z}$ contains nonzero elements $a,b$ of infinite order such that $a+b$ has finite order. 
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    If $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$ and $k| n$, then $G$ has exactly one subgroup of order $k$.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    Let $p$ be prime and $H$ a subgroup of $Z(p^{\infty})$.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Every element of $Z(p^{\infty})$ has finite order $p^{n}$ for some $n\geq 0$.
        \item If at least one element of $H$ has order $p^{k}$ and no element of $H$ has order greater than $p^{k}$, then $H$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by $\bar{1/p^{k}}$, whence $H\cong Z_{p^{k}}$.
        \item If there is no upper bound on the orders of elements of $H$, then $H=Z(p^{\infty})$.
        \item The only proper subgroups of $Z(p^{\infty})$ are the finite cyclic groups $C_{n}=\left\langle\bar{1/p^{n}}\right\rangle\,(n=1,2,\dots)$. Futhermore, $\left\langle0\right\rangle=C_{0}<C_{1}<C_{2}<C_{3}<\cdots$.
        \item Let $x_{1},x_{2},\dots$ be elements of an abelian group $G$ such that $\left| x_{1} \right| =p, px_{2}=x_{1},px_{3}=x_{2},\dots,px_{n+1}=x_{n},\dots$. The subgroup generated by the $x_{i}(i\geq 1)$ is isomorphic to $Z(p^{\infty})$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    A group that has only a finite number of subgroups must be finite.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    If $G$ is an abelian group, then the set $T$ of all elements of $G$ with finite order is a subgroup of $G$.
\end{ex}

$$ $$

\begin{ex}
    An infinite group is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to each of its proper subgroups.
