\section{Function}

A function or mapping $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ is a rule, or formula, or assignment, or relation of association that assigns to each $x\in X$ a unique element $y\in Y$.

Here we call $X$ the domain of the function $f$,. Elements $x\in X$ are the arguments  of the function. The elements $y\in Y$ are the dependent varibles(the image of $x$), denoted by the symbol $f(x)$.
The set $Y$ is made of the value of the function,which called the range or codomain of the function $f$.
\[f(X):=\{y\in Y|\, \exists x((x\in X)\wedge(y=f(x))\}\]
We often use the symbol \[f:X\longrightarrow Y,X\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}Y\]to donate the function $f$.
